# Doji's CSGO Configs

## About

One of the things I like most about CS:GO is the abilities given to users to cutomise their experience. I have a lot of fun finding good or silly binds and aliases that make the experience more enjoyable.

## Contents

* My configuration
* Friend configs
	* Abe
	* Sam

## Usage

Paste the files into 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg' (or whatever folder/drive you installed steam on)

You can edit the default crosshair in '05_crosshair.cfg'.
You can edit the binds in one of the '09_' files (or create a new one) and change the autoexec.cfg file to execut it.
